        <h style="color: red;"> <strong> Coronavirus disease </strong> </h> 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease
        caused by severe acute respiratory
        syndrome.The first known case was identified in <strong>
            <h style="color: red;">WUHAN CHINA,
        </strong> </h>in December 2019. The disease has since spread worldwide, leading to an outgoing pandemic.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Symtoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatique
        breathing difficulties and
        loss of smell and taste.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of
        those people who develop
        symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most(81%) develop mild to moderate sympyoms (up to mild
        pneumonia), while 14% develop severe sympyoms (dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involements on imaging),
        and 5% suffer critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or
        multiorgan dysfunction). older people are at a highar risk of developing severe symptoms. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Several testing methods heve been developed to dignose the disease. The standard
        diagnostic method is by
        detecting of the virus' nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR),
        transcription-mediated amplification(TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal
        amplification(RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab.</p>

    <h2 style="color:brown;">TREATMENT</h2>
    <P style="font-size: 20px;"> There is no specific, effective treatment or cure for coronavirus disease 2019
        (COVID-19), the disease caused by
        the <strong>
            <h style="color:red;"> SARS-CoV virus.</h>
        </strong> The lack of progress developing effective treatments means that the cornerstone of management of
        COVID-19 has been supportive care, which includes treatment to relieve symptoms, fluid therapy, oxygen support
        and prone positioning as needed, and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.</P>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such as
        <h style="color:red;">
            paracetamol or NSAIDs </h>to relieve symptoms, proper intake of fluids, rest, and
        nasal breathing.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> People with more severe cases may need treatment in the hospital. In those with low
        oxygen levels, use of the
        glucocorticoid dexamethasone is strongly recommended, as it can reduce the risk of death.Several experimental
        tratments are being actively studied in clinical trials. These include fluvoxamine, a cheap and widely available
        antidepressant; and the antivirals molnupiravir. Others were found to be promising early in the pandemic, such
        as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, but later research found them to be ineffective or even harmful.

    <h2 style="color: brown;"> PRECAUTIONS</h2>
    <ul>

        <li style="color: chartreuse; font-size: 20px;">Maintain a safe distane from others, even if they don't appear
            to be sick.</li>
        <li style="color: chartreuse; font-size: 20px;">Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical
            distancing is not possible.</li>
        <li style="color: chartreuse; font-size: 20px;"> Get vaccinated when it's your turn. Follow local guidance about
            vaccination. </li>
        <li style="color: chartreuse; font-size: 20px;"> Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based
            hand rub.</li>
        <li style="color: chartreuse; font-size: 20px;"> Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
